\section{Multi/Many-Core Architectures}
\label{sec:overview}

We now provide a brief overview of multi-core and many-core architectures and
highlight the common trends that are prevailant in commercial off-the-shelf
(\emph{COTS}) hardware.

\subsection{Massive Parallelism}

- Offer lots of cores
- Lots of parallelism to be exploited
- Unclear what is the best approach to exploit this?

\subsection{Processor Interconnects}

- Interconnects allow communication between processors
- Shared memory, memory consistency
- Interconnects are the new bottleneck? Shift of bottlenecks?

\subsection{Complex Memory Hierarchies}

- Multi-level memory hierarchies help mask access latencies
- Now with the added complexity that they need to be consistent
- Is memory consistency an inherent requirement? Can it be discarded entirely?
