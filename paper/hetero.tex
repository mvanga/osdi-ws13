 \section{A Taxonomy of Heterogeneity}

The following texts are overview papers/textbooks which
broadly describe the area, or motivate the transition
to multicore
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Programming Many Core Chips}: Textbook overview
on multicore systems with heavy focus on heterogeneity \cite{Vajda:1414193}.

\item \emph{Heterogeneous Chip Multiprocessors} General overview
of the design space and motivation for moving to multiprocessors \cite{Kumar:2005:HCM:1100859.1100890}.
\item \emph{Amdahl's Law in the Multicore Era} Using Ahmdahl's law,
calculates potential speedup with regards to number of cores
in symmetric, asymmetric, and dynamic chips \cite{4563876}.
\item \emph{Single-Chip Heterogeneous Computing: Does the Future Include Custom 
Logic, FPGAs, and GPGPUs?} Debates on the future 
of heterogeneous chips, specifically, just quite how diverse
are future designs going to be? \cite{5695539}
\item \emph{Scaling the bandwidth wall: challenges in and avenues for CMP scaling}
Identifies off chip memory bandwidth as the main challenge for future chip multi-
processor designs. Link to heterogeneity is a little bit more tenuous, but
provides useful insight on what future designs are likely to look like \cite{Rogers_scalingthe}.
\item \emph{Rodinia: A Benchmark Suite for Heterogeneous Computing} Aims
to be the SPEC benchmark equivalent targeted specifically towards heterogeneous
computing (multiple CPUS, and GPUs). Provides indications of what the likely
bottlenecks ins such machines are, or likely to be with regards to application
characteristics \cite{5306797}.
\item \emph{Thousand Core Chipsâ€”A Technology Perspective} Describes the
architectural challenges that arise in a 1000 core chips, focusing
on memory bandwidth, power management and resilience \cite{Borkar:2007:TCC:1278480.1278667}.

applications also need to be. \cite{Balakrishnan:2005:IPA:1069807.1070012} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Power Consumption}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core architectures: the potential 
for processor power reduction}  Multiple cores on a chip with different power
footprints. Dynamically switches between all of them to match specific target.
Makes tradeoff between power and performance explicit \cite{KFJRT:03}
\item \emph {Maximizing Power Efficiency with Asymmetric Multicore Systems
} Focuses on the challenges of specialisation in asymmetric multicore systems,
more specificlaly on how to cater to thread level parallelism and instruction level
parallelism (ex: not all programs, parts of programs will exhibit the same
amount of ILP and thus benefit more or less from running on a more complex
processor) \cite{FSSP:09}

to smaller transistors, reliability is going to become an issue. Suggests
research directions on how to handle it. \cite{FSC}
\item \emph{Mixed-Mode Multicore Reliability} Identifies two classes
of applications: those that need to run on reliable hardware, and those
 that don't. Design new paradigm: Mixed Mode Multicore, which can
run normal applications without the throughput overhead of reliability
and those that requier dual modular redundancy. Presents mechanisms
for switching between the two. Note - this is not quite
reliability between processors, but rather exploiting multicore
to achieve different reliability rates. \cite{WCS:09}
\item \emph{Adapting to intermittent faults in multicore systems}

caused by intermittent faults. \cite{WCS:08}

Demonstrates that through proper assignments of threads to core, heterogeneity
can actually significantly improve performance (not just power). This is not
limited to HPC. Two main reasons they highlight: more efficient die use for thread
level parallelism (can therefore exploit more TLP for the same die area), 2)
better adaptation to application diversity (different applications or parts

core characteristics. \cite{knauerhase2008using}
\item \emph{An Asymmetric Distributed Shared Memory Model for Heterogeneous Parallel Systems}
Seems specifically targeted towards CPU vs GPUS. But makes the claim for an asymmetric
