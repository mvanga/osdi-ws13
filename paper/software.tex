\section{Dealing with Heterogeneity}

With the rise of heterogeneous multicores, the responsibility
for using the processors efficiently has shifted from the hardware
to the software and the programmer. This raises three questions:
is heterogeneity something to be put with, or an opportunity for
better programs? where should heterogeneity be handled? And finally,
are applications required to make similar tradeoffs between
performance, power, and programmability as the hardware?
