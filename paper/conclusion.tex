\section{Conclusion}

\paragraph{}Multicore processors exhibit significant heterogeneity, through processor or core specialisation, in a bid
to maximise the performance-power ratio. Our 
survey of heterogeneity identified a tension :
whilst computer architecture research increased
the specialisation of processors and individual cores,
often at the expense of programmibility, 
operating system and applications have generally 
hidden heterogeneity from developers. Most processors 
continue to use variants of Linux independent of
whether they are servers or desktop computers. 
Whilst modern OSes are NUMA-aware, they are not specialised for the underlying architecture
Inter-machine heterogeneity is relatively poorly taken into account. Similarly, 
few applications are able to exploit intra-machine
heterogeneity due to a lack of consistent primitives exposing it. (TODO rephrase)


\paragraph{} Our survey thus suggests that OS and software research should focus on two directions:
firstly, on designing operating systems
optimised for specific comptuer designs, and secondly, 
on identifying the correct ways to expose heterogeneity
to applications. Helios~\cite{nightingale2009helios} and Barrelfish's System Knowledge Base ~\cite{schupbach08embracingdiversity} are steps in that direction.
