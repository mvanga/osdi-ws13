\emph{
In this paper, we describe the factors that have led to the widespread adoption
of multi-core and many-core architectures and presents various trends that have
been observed by two different communities with regard to their evolution;
namely the architecture community and the systems software community. We then
present what we believe are the three axes of tradeoffs that system
programmers need to be aware of when designing software for such architectures:
power, performance and programmability.
