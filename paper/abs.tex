\emph{
This document is a tentative reading list for the topic of heterogeneity in
multi-core architectures. The list tries to look at heterogeneity from
multiple points of view and tries to taxonomize it clearly. The
current organisation seeks only to provide a broad classification of
papers suggested and is by no means fixed. Many papers appear in multiple sections, or will
appear in different sections in the future.
